# quickstart.sh — seed a Smooth account with a small demo, and learn to script
# the `smooth` CLI by reading it.
#
# This is nothing but a list of ordinary `smooth` commands. Read it top to
# bottom to see how the pieces fit together; run it to give a fresh account
# (e.g. the hosted sandbox) something to explore.
#
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Prerequisites (see docs/SANDBOX.md):
#
#   pip install loobric-smooth
#   export SMOOTH_BASE_URL=https://api.loobric.com
#   smooth register you@example.com
#   smooth login    you@example.com
#   smooth create-key sandbox --scopes "read write"
#   export SMOOTH_API_KEY=<the key it printed>     # the CLI reads this automatically
#
# Then run:   bash quickstart.sh
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Meant for a FRESH account. It's safe to re-run — the catalog records dedupe on
# their natural key (a re-run just reports them as already present) — but a
# re-run does create another demo machine and tool set. Wipe first with
# `smooth reset --yes` if you want a clean slate.

# Read no command's stdin from this script, so `cat quickstart.sh | bash` can't
# accidentally feed the script text into a command. Every value below is a flag.

# Fail fast with a clear message if the environment isn't set up. `list-machines`
# is a cheap authenticated call — it works with either a session or an API key,
# so it's a reliable "am I signed in?" probe.
